This is a high level representation of the JSON I need on the frontend to render articles
from the database.

The complicated part is the contentBlocks. Every contentblock is converted into a
html block by the contentRenderer component on the frontend. It contains data
about text, type and inline styles of every contentblock. It must have a
very specific format to match the input, the contentRenderer component needs.
I console log an array of contentblocks on the home page so you can get an idea
of how it looks like.

The coding challenge I will send you on monday is about working with that data.
This is a good opportunity to get more familiar with the data structure and how
everything works in general.
